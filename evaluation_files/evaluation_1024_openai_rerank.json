Similiar to Flan-T5,  one can directly use FLAN-UL2 weights without finetuning the model: UL2 (ul2) According ot the original blog here are the notable improvements: The original UL2 model was only trained with receptive field of 512, which made it non-ideal for N-shot prompting where N is large. The Flan-UL2 checkpoint uses a receptive field of 2048 which makes it more usable for few-shot in-context learning. The original UL2 model also had mode switch tokens that was rather mandatory to get good performance. However, they were a little cumbersome as this requires often some changes during inference or finetuning. In this update/change, we continue training UL2 20B for an additional 100k steps (with small batch) to forget \u201cmode tokens\u201d before applying Flan instruction tuning. This Flan-UL2 checkpoint does not require mode tokens anymore.'"

    "eight_context_answer": "Falcon's architecture is optimized for inference in several ways. Firstly, it incorporates multi-query attention, which allows the model to process multiple queries simultaneously, improving efficiency during inference. Additionally, Falcon supports efficient attention variants like FlashAttention, which further enhances the speed and efficiency of the model during inference. These optimizations make Falcon well-suited for real-time or low-latency applications where fast inference is crucial."

The models were trained using bfloat16, but evaluation metrics show no discernible degradation when using float16. Running inference with float16 is usually faster than bfloat16. It is recommended to check the inference results with both float16 and bfloat16 after fine-tuning. However, the choice of precision is mostly irrelevant unless you are using torch_dtype=\"auto\" when initializing the model. By default, the models are loaded in float32 precision.

    "eight_context_answer": "To create a mask for sequence pair classification in ALBERT models, you can use the `create_token_type_ids_from_sequences` method of the ALBERT tokenizer. This method takes two lists of token IDs as input, where each list represents a sequence in the sequence pair. The method then generates a mask, known as the token type IDs, which distinguishes between the two sequences in the pair.\n\nThe token type IDs mask has the following format: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1. The first sequence is represented by 0s, and the second sequence is represented by 1s.\n\nBy using this mask, the ALBERT model can differentiate between the two sequences during training or inference for sequence pair classification tasks."

This is the most common precision and provides good accuracy but may require more memory and computational resources.\n\n2. bfloat16: If the model was trained using bfloat16, it is recommended to use this precision for further training or fine-tuning. bfloat16 can provide good accuracy while reducing memory usage and computational requirements.\n\n3. float16: For inference, float16 is often faster than bfloat16 and may not show any noticeable degradation in evaluation metrics. If speed is a priority and you are not concerned about a slight decrease in accuracy, you can use float16 for inference.\n\nTo specify the precision when loading a model using the AutoModel API, you can use the `torch_dtype` parameter. For example:\n\n```python\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\"path\", torch_dtype=\"auto\")\n```\n\nNote that the availability of different precisions may depend on the specific model and hardware you are using.

BigBird, is a sparse-attention\\nbased transformer which extends Transformer based models, such as BERT to much longer sequences. In addition to sparse\\nattention, BigBird also applies global attention as well as random attention to the input sequence. Theoretically, it\\nhas been shown that applying sparse, global, and random attention approximates full attention, while being\\ncomputationally much more efficient for longer sequences. As a consequence of the capability to handle longer context,\\nBigBird has shown improved performance on various long document NLP tasks, such as question answering and'",
