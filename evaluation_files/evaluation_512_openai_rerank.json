    "eight_context_answer": "To create a mask for sequence pair classification in ALBERT models, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Tokenize the input sequences using the ALBERT tokenizer.\n2. Add special tokens to the sequences, such as [CLS] at the beginning and [SEP] between the two sequences.\n3. Create a mask called the \"sequence pair mask\" that indicates which tokens belong to the first sequence and which tokens belong to the second sequence. This mask will have a length equal to the maximum sequence length.\n4. Set the values of the sequence pair mask to 0 for tokens belonging to the first sequence and 1 for tokens belonging to the second sequence.\n5. Pad the sequence pair mask with 0s to match the maximum sequence length.\n\nThe resulting sequence pair mask will have a format like this: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1, where 0s represent tokens from the first sequence and 1s represent tokens from the second sequence."
